# Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP)

This repository contains the projects I completed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. This experience was a great opportunity to learn and apply my skills in software development, covering desktop applications, web development, and more.

## Projects

Here's a summary of the projects included in this repository.

### 1. BMI Calculator

*   **Directory:** `Task-2_bmi-calculator/`
*   **Description:** A desktop application built with Python that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). The application provides a user-friendly graphical interface to input height and weight, see the calculated BMI, and view their historical data. The history is visualized using a graphical plot.
*   **Technologies Used:**
    *   **Core:** Python
    *   **GUI:** PyQt6
    *   **Data Storage:** SQLite
    *   **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib
*   **What I Learned:**
    *   Building desktop applications from scratch using Python and the PyQt6 framework.
    *   Designing and implementing a clean, user-friendly graphical interface.
    *   Handling user input and performing application logic.
    *   Storing and retrieving data from a local SQLite database.
    *   Creating data visualizations with Matplotlib to provide users with meaningful feedback.

### 2. Password Generator

*   **Directory:** `Task-3_password-generator/`
*   **Description:** A desktop utility that generates strong, customizable passwords to enhance security. The user can specify the password length and choose to include different character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols). The generated password can be easily copied to the clipboard. The application also features the ability to save the passwords securely.
*   **Technologies Used:**
    *   **Core:** Python
    *   **GUI:** PyQt6
    *   **Security:** `cryptography` library for encryption
    *   **Clipboard:** `pyperclip` library
*   **What I Learned:**
    *   Advanced GUI development with PyQt6, focusing on user interaction and responsive design.
    *   Implementing core logic for random and secure password generation.
    *   Applying cryptographic techniques to securely store sensitive user data.
    *   Interacting with the operating system's clipboard for a better user experience.

### 3. Real-Time Chat Application

*   **Directory:** `Task5-ChatApp/`
*   **Description:** A full-stack web application that enables users to communicate in real-time. It features user authentication (signup/login), the ability to create or join chat rooms, and instant messaging.
*   **Technologies Used:**
    *   **Backend:** Python, Flask, Flask-SocketIO, eventlet
    *   **Database:** MongoDB (with `pymongo`)
    *   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    *   **Templating:** Jinja2
*   **What I Learned:**
    *   Full-stack web development principles using the Flask framework.
    *   Implementing real-time communication with WebSockets via Flask-SocketIO.
    *   Building a NoSQL database schema and interacting with MongoDB for user and message data.
    *   Developing a dynamic frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that communicates with the backend.
    *   Managing user sessions and implementing a complete authentication flow.
